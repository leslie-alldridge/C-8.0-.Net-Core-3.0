Keywords such as **string** that look like types are aliases, which represent types provided by the platform on which C# runs.

Casing:
- camelCase for local variables and private fields
- TitleCase for non-private fields and methods

• Literal string: Characters enclosed in double-quote characters. They can use
escape characters like \t for tab.

• Verbatim string: A literal string prefixed with @ to disable escape characters
so that a backslash is a backslash.

• Interpolated string: A literal string prefixed with $ to enable embedded
formatted variables. You will learn more about this later in this chapter.

#### Numbers
