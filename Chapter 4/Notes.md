This chapter covers the following topics:
• Writing functions
• Debugging during development
• Logging during runtime
• Unit testing

Numbers that are used to count are called cardinal numbers, for example, 1, 2, and 3.

Whereas numbers that are used to order are ordinal numbers, for example, 1st, 2nd,
and 3rd.

Recursion is clever, but it can lead to problems, such as a stack overflow due to too many function calls because memory is used to store data on every function call and it eventually uses too much.
